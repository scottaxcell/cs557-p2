HOW TO BUILD
============
$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf


==========
HOW TO RUN
==========
$ ./build/bin/fshare -n <nodename> [-p <filename>] [-d <filename>] [-h]

Note: The nodename needs to be specified so that the program knows which
file is associated with the node that program is being run on. This could
have possibily been calculated dynamically using the hostname, but I chose
to focus my energy on the networking portion of this project instead.


==================
EXPERIMENT NS FILE
==================
The NS file I used in the experiment can be found in the same directory
as this README file. It is named project2_ns.tcl.


==================
EXPERIMENT RESULTS
==================
Please see the download log times for /cs557/test1 and /csu557/test2 for each
interested node in the experimentResults directory.

I observed that the first node to attempt to download the published file
took the longest amount of time. The subsequent downloads on the same node
and on other nodes in the network was substantially faster. For example,
node1 was first to download /cs557/test1 and it took 2.5 seconds. Subsequent
initial downloads from the other nodes in the network took 1.5 seconds. Then
all following downloads, after the initial download, took 20 ms.

The behavior I saw and described above appears to make sense from what I've
learned about NDN. The first interest from node1 in the published file needs 
to propogate to the publishing node, nodeA. Then the initial interest in from
node2 and node3 can then download the file from the cache in router0. Hence,
we see the shorter download time. Then the nine subsequent downloads from
node1, node2, and node3 all have the file already in the cache and so there
is no need to send an interest to router0 or nodeA. We can see this by the
extremely small download times.

Note: For /cs557/test2, node3 was the first node to show interest in the file so
it has the longest initial download time. Whereas for /cs557/test1, node1 was
the first to show interest.
